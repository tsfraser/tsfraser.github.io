   <h1>About me:</h1>
		<p> Prior to starting my PhD at UWaterloo, I did my MSc at the University of St Andrews, with my Master's thesis focusing on applying unsupervised clustering to galaxies from the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation. Our work led to some very interesting results, which have currently been submitted as a publication to MNRAS (Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: LINK HERE),
				    and as a poster with preliminary results to the 2021 National Astronomy Meeting <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/nam-2021/tristan-fraser">(NAM2021 poster)</a> . I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, with an Honours BSc degree specialising in physics with a minor in mathematics.  </p>
