<div class ="blurb">

		<p> Prior to starting my PhD at UWaterloo, I did my MSc at the University of St Andrews supervised by Dr. Rita Tojeiro, with my Master's thesis focusing on applying unsupervised clustering to galaxies from the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation. My work led to some very interesting results, which have currently been submitted as a publication to MNRAS (Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: LINK HERE),
				    and as a poster with preliminary results to the 2021 National Astronomy Meeting <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/nam-2021/tristan-fraser">(NAM2021 poster)</a>.I also did an additional project with Dr. Anne-Marie Weijmans, focusing on the intrinsic shapes of SDSS galaxies.  </p>
	
		<p> I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Canada.
