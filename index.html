		<p> I'm a first year PhD student at the Unversity of Waterloo's Waterloo Centre for Astrophysics (WCA) working with Professor Will Percival. My work focuses on cosmic voids in the Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI) survey, and using them to trace the evolution of large scale structure in the expanding universe. I host both my work and personal projects on this site! </p>
