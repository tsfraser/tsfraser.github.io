        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Tristan Fraser!</h1>
			<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/main.css">
				<p> I'm a first year PhD student at the Unversity of Waterloo's Waterloo Centre for Astrophysics (WCA) working with Professor Will Percival. My work focuses on cosmic voids in the Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI) survey, and using them to trace the evolution of large scale structure in the expanding universe. I host both my work and personal projects on this site! </p>
				<p> Prior to starting my PhD at UWaterloo, I did my MSc at the University of St Andrews, with my Master's thesis focusing on applying unsupervised clustering to galaxies from the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation. Our work led to some very interesting results, which have currently been submitted as a publication to MNRAS (Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: LINK HERE), and as a poster with preliminary results to the 2021 National Astronomy Meeting (NAM2021 - LINK HERE). I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, with an Honours BSc degree specialising in physics with a minor in mathematics.
